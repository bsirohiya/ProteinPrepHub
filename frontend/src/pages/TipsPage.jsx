      <h2>Cooking Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use multiple protein sources:</strong> Combine legumes (like lentils or chickpeas) with whole grains (like brown rice or quinoa) to get a complete amino acid profile in vegetarian meals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook in bulk & meal prep:</strong> Batch-cook beans, quinoa, or tofu at the start of the week. This saves time and encourages consistent healthy eating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marinate tofu, paneer, and chicken:</strong> Use simple marinades with lemon, olive oil, garlic, and spices for at least 30 minutes to boost flavor without extra calories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Roast instead of fry:</strong> Roasting chickpeas, veggies, or paneer in the oven helps retain nutrients and cuts down on oil, making the meal lighter and more nutritious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add seeds and nuts:</strong> Sprinkle chia seeds, hemp seeds, almonds, or pumpkin seeds on top of salads, soups, or curries to add crunch and a protein boost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Include fermented or sprouted ingredients:</strong> Sprouting beans (like mung or black chana) increases protein bioavailability and improves digestion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Greek yogurt or hung curd:</strong> As a base for sauces or dips, this adds creaminess and significantly boosts protein without adding fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Donâ€™t overcook proteins:</strong> Overcooking eggs, tofu, or paneer can make them rubbery. Cook just until set to preserve texture and nutrients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balance with healthy fats and fiber:</strong> Adding avocado, olive oil, or fibrous veggies like spinach improves satiety and digestion alongside your protein intake.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experiment with spices:</strong> Use turmeric, cumin, smoked paprika, and fresh herbs to elevate flavors naturally without extra salt or processed sauces.
        </li>
      </ul>
